(I dont know how to write a good README)

This is a Repo where I will upload my custom applications coded in BASIC+GAMBAS for my (semi-custom) take on debian 12 named "rmOS"

(The name stems from the panic button application that will nuke your drive in one click, in case of a  malware infection, and you don't care about your files)

I suck at implementing things and have zero experience with coding or app intergration, so this is not going to be polished,
but anyways I hope you like it!
